# Generate Music with Magenta
 With this code i use the magenta library from google to produce sound generated by an Neural Network

First you have to put the Midi Files you want the Network to train on in the "Dataset" Folder

Then you have to execute the Powershell Script "Train.ps1"

Then you have to put a soundfont of your choice into the soundfont folder

At last you have to start the "Generate.ps1" script adn the network you trained should produce Midi Files with new SOngs
